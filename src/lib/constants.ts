      "In a world in which our imaginations are depleted and barren from the infinite array of traumas we perpetrate against each other and the creation, we desperately need voices that can reawaken us to hope and to the action that will embody it. Redeeming Heartache delivers to us that very hope-in-action that we so desperately need.",

    quote:
      "Redeeming Heartache is a gift to a wounded world -- beautifully written, emotionally powerful, vulnerable and transparent, filled with wisdom. Dan Allender and Cathy Loerzel help us understand trauma and suffering through stories and studies, with sensitivity and sophistication, through the prism of faith.",

    quote:
      "Coauthors Dr. Dan Allender and Cathy Loerzel invite us to courageously grapple with the pain, suffering, and trauma we all experience “east of Eden” – living outside of the perfection and wholeness that characterized humanity’s first home – and identify our fear, shame and grief.",

              I am a self diagnosed 3 on the Enneagram, a mother of 6 and 8 year

              I love dogs and horses and I come alive around water... lakes,
              oceans, rivers, creeks, swamps - you name it - I love it.

            <p>
              My dream is to be able to have a house where I can drink coffee
              every morning looking at water.

              I&#39;ve spent the last 15 years developing the theory and
              methodology of a popular coaching and therapeutic approach called{" "}
              <strong>Story Work</strong>, which moves people through their past
              stories of heartache to heal and discover healthier ways of being
              in the world.

            I believe that if we are honest, we know that none of us have
            escaped heartache and trauma in this beautifully broken world. The
            question then is how we heal in order not just to make it through,
            but truly thrive in the light of all that God would hope for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Story Work</strong> will help you understand how harm and
            heartache have come into your life and what you have done to protect
            yourself from it in both brilliant and heartbreaking ways.
          </p>
          <p className="md:col-span-3">
            It will then usher you into the radically hopeful call to remember
            your name and join God in the redemptive arc of the gospel that is
            still alive and well and wooing us to be honest, grieve, and repair
            that which has been shattered and join Jesus in breathing new life
            into this shattered world, starting with our own hearts.

              Aside from doing this work, I am passionate about cooking,

              I&#39;m also generally astonished by my family&#39;s capacity to
              wreak havoc on a clean house and I&#39;m bound and determined to
              raise boys who clean up after themselves. We are all a work in

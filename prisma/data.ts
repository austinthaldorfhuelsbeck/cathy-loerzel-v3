      "<p>As is true for most people who have children, I have found a very distinctive \u201cbefore and after\u201d aspect in the transition to parenthood. I don\u2019t think anyone can predict how the \u201cafter\u201d will look, and there is very little to do to prepare for what will be a very personal, particular transition that ultimately turns your world on its head like a shaken-up snow globe where none of the pieces are glued to the ground. Your landscape shifts, your body changes, your perspective is altered, and there is no going back to the \u201cbefore.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>I had my son 16 months ago, and I am just now emerging from the cloud of disorientation and beginning to be able to name the reality of my \u201cafter.\u201d I realize every woman is different, and some step into motherhood with a graceful fluidity, but this was not the case for me. My transition felt like hitting a brick wall at 60 miles per hour, not only shattering my perfectly designed external world, but also exposing the underbelly of my heart in a way I never expected.</p><p>When I was pregnant, I remember sitting with a friend who has two children. He jokingly asked how I felt about the fact that my career was about to get pummeled due to my coming mommy-hood. I got angry at him for the assumption that my career was going to take a blow and told him that I thought maybe I would become tenderized, not pummeled. I had no idea how prophetic that phrase would turn out to be.</p><p><br></p><p>I had anticipated the sleepless nights, the pure exhaustion, and the reality of a tiny human needing me all the time, but I had not anticipated the emotional impact. Having my baby opened my heart and body to fear, anxiety, depression, uncontrollable tears, and heartbreak. Much of my experience has to do with the hormonal shifts that caused a season of postpartum depression, and while I have been fully aware of this component, I don\u2019t want to chalk it all up to the hormonal shift. To dismiss this tenderness would be to ignore and belittle a very important shift\u2014one that could teach a little more about the mother heart of God and allow my new-found tenderness to find a home in my heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Next Thursday, Cathy will continue this reflection by writing about how the birth of her son has thinned the veil between this world and the dream of Eden, making the realities of pain and violence even more stark in contrast to the gifts of goodness and beauty.</p>",

      '<p>When my son was born, it is as if the veil between this world and the dream of Eden became a very thin line. I could barely handle violence on TV, reading about abuse in the news, or seeing the ravages of war ripping our world apart. I had to do significant research before watching a movie to make sure it was something I could handle, because I was vulnerable to every story I encountered. In truth, I was heartbroken by the wounded world my beautiful baby boy would encounter, and the reality of what he will suffer took my breath away.</p><p><br></p><p>I was completely undone when I looked at my sweet, trusting, curious child, knowing in my bones he was meant to experience uninterrupted beauty, goodness, and care. Now, looking back, I am in awe of my new-found empathy and quickness to tears and am rattled by how vulnerable I feel. I believe this thinly laced veil allows me to understand the love my son deserves, and it gives me a glimpse into what my heart was designed for as well. This may sound a little dramatic, but I wonder if this is not the way it is supposed to be? Why aren\u2019t we on our knees wailing for the brokenness of our world? Why don\u2019t we get choked up when we catch a glimpse of the harm we have endured? Why aren\u2019t we praying and begging God to help us bring healing and protection and restoration to our world?</p><p><br></p><p>My sweet, beautiful, and wondrous boy has absolutely broken me.&nbsp;As I have encountered his sweet heart, I have been taken by beauty and love in a way that has opened my heart and ruined me for this harsh world. I believe fully that we can only love to the degree we are willing to grieve, and in opening myself to love, I am now more susceptible to grief in a way that is both beautiful and terrifying.</p><p><br></p><p>Before he was born, I remember talking to a dear friend and admitting that I was afraid I might not love my son. After he was born my friend came over and asked me how I felt about that fear now. I looked at her through thick tears and said that I\u2019m not afraid of not loving him, I\u2019m afraid I will never be able to love anything else, other than him, ever again. But it turns out, it is quite the opposite. As my heart grows in its capacity, my ability to love and to feel is magnified.</p><p>My heart is now sensitive and ready to weep, and while this is admittedly inconvenient at times, I am so so grateful that when I sit with another story, when I consider my own harm, when I am faced with how I have harmed others, all I need to do is picture my sweet boy and I am immediately in touch with what Eden promised and the intention of God. This realization softens my heart, opens my hands, and casts my vision to the little boy or girl in all of us that needs and, quite frankly, deserves care. So I am pummeled, I am changed, and as is true for all deep change, it came from the complete undoing of a dramatic \u201cbefore and after.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Now as the months roll by, the veil is a little thicker, but I continue to make space for this new \u201cafter\u201d and the gift of a pummelled heart. I get to be tender in a harsh and beautiful world where I will raise my son and sit with him as he encounters the wonder of the earth, the love of friends, and the violence of abuse. My only hope is that I will protect my new heart and not ask it to be hardened once more. I hope to be a tender and fierce presence that is quick to weep, slow to judge, and eager to love. I pray I am always sensitive to the realities of brokenness and that this sensitivity would keep my heart open and curious just like my sweet, wondrous boy.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>I hope to be a tender and fierce presence that is quick to weep, slow to judge, and eager to love.\u201d </em><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&amp;text=I%20hope%20to%20be%20a%20tender%20and%20fierce%20presence%20that%20is%20quick%20to%20weep%2C%20slow%20to%20judge%2C%20and%20eager%20to%20love.%E2%80%9D&amp;url=https://theallendercenter.org/2015/04/able-to-love-2/&amp;via=allendercenter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);"><em>Tweet this</em></a></blockquote>',

That can either happen through small things over time or large, cataclysmic events.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Cathy Loerzel</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI think in some ways I thought I was a really good priest, but I was actually functioning more as an orphan because there was something I needed to grow in a capacity for honor, autonomy, personhood, and trust\u2014a reconnection to community that allows you to serve people and hold the complexity of joy and sorrow, which is in some ways what a priest gets to offer the people.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Rachael Clinton Chen</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cA priest will call you back to gratitude and lament, and both are interwoven into the story of humanity, but the priest can hold both. So, I think what happens is the orphan, who is trying has instincts towards the priest but hasn\u2019t actually grieved their own story, will only want to remember the goodness. A priest who still has a very active orphan will be the one who only wants to tell the good stories.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Cathy Loerzel</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTo bear stories and to be a storyteller is such a profound privilege because it\u2019s also a part of identifying yourself, too. When these wounded parts of us experience healing they give us back parts of ourselves as we live into these ways of being in the midst of the kingdom that we\u2019re called to, there is a restoration that happens.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Rachael Clinton Chen</strong></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2><ul><li>We are in a wild, rapidly changing season.

What are the wounds that impact a king or queen, what does true leadership look like, and how does a king or queen bring order to God\u2019s kingdom?</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere is something about being bereft in the middle of some level of significant loss of love that is so crucial for a king/queen to be able to hold and move into. This has been a horrendous time with so many losses, so much complexity, not only culturally but in terms of families.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Dr. Dan Allender</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe widowed heart can either move to a kind of \u201cI just won\u2019t have desire, pleasure, I\u2019ll cut off this capacity and therefore be free to rule and reign unencumbered,\u201d or it can lead to an indulgence in pleasure that keeps the heart from the love we\u2019re most meant for.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Rachael Clinton Chen</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe queen category is a primary place of comfortability for me. A lot of the work I do is creating boundaries, figuring out systems or order that needs to be in place for things to come to be, and more than anything I find myself being the one who can look at a problem and say \u201cOk, we can figure out a way through and these are the five steps and this is how we\u2019re going to go and everyone get on board and let\u2019s do it.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Cathy Loerzel</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhen I think about kings/queens I think about lovers, imagining a world where flourishing is the status quo, where we are living in the ways we are most meant to, so the category of widow/widower makes sense as some of the core woundings because there is a sense of knowing you are made for love and knowing there is a way you can create a world where love flourishes, where there\u2019s a mutual giving and receiving of pleasure, where justice and mercy reign supreme without effort on behalf of all, so on a very grand scale you\u2019re constantly working in the midst of chaos and brokenness to bring about these realities.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Rachael Clinton Chen</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhen the king or queen is as you would wish for them to be on your behalf, there\u2019s nothing greater, but the moment that decisions, directions get taken that are not in accord, there\u2019s no position more vilified than a king or queen who is not doing what we, the people, the community, desires.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Dr. Dan Allender</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe weight is intense and it needs to be intense because what you\u2019re called to manage is public, typically it has a lot of consequence and you\u2019re asked to make very difficult decisions that are not necessarily going to be popular but they are the wisest decision that you could make in the moment. And when you do make them, you also need to be the first to own your failure. So there is a tremendous amount of weight that comes from this station of being a king or a queen.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Cathy Loerzel</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTo be truly, even if its a misused term, a true servant leader who knows what it is to be at the table rather than sitting at the table is a rare leader and requires a lot of death\u2014 to self, to dreams, and power, in order to utilize power in a way that brings honor and goodness.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Dr. Dan Allender</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re building a structure that allows for flourishing, mutuality, voices to be at the table, which also allows for significant parts of the leadership community to be filled by prophets, priests, and other kings and queens and allow the fullness of the table to be set so we can all move together for the glory of God and be able to honor what we bring to the table, not diminish it, not decrease it because it is collective, it\u2019s a community.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>Cathy Loerzel</strong></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2><ul><li>Listen to a podcast series with Cathy and Dan about \u201c<a href="https://theallendercenter.org/category/podcast/complexities-in-leadership/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);">Complexities in Leadership</a>\u201d</li><li>Listen to a podcast series with Rachael and Dan about \u201c<a href="https://theallendercenter.org/category/podcast/binds-of-leadership/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);">The Binds of Leadership</a>\u201d</li><li>Read a blog post by Danielle Castillejo about leaders and \u201c<a href="https://theallendercenter.org/2019/10/fighting-eye-needle/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);">Fighting Through the Eye of the Needle</a>\u201d</li></ul><p><br></p>',

Dan believes that people who are good leaders are also reluctant leaders, a theme you will hear throughout their conversation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;I believe, at the depths of my being, that people who are good leaders are reluctant leaders. Who, in many ways, don\u2019t have the ambition to lead but end up finding themselves nonetheless in a position in which they get cornered by God.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;Even when you start talking about leadership, immediately there\u2019s something in me that wants to run the other direction. As soon as you name yourself a leader or believe you have something to say on how to lead there are problems that immediately come to bear.</p><p><br></p><p>Cathy notes that&nbsp;<a href="http://theallendercenter.org/2016/06/binds-of-leadership-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(147, 74, 38);">leadership</a>&nbsp;isn\u2019t something one necessarily chooses, but something that is inside of you. She illustrates by describing how she took charge of a group photo that was not going well until she stepped in to help organize its participants.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;There\u2019s something in me that\u2019s always standing back and seeing if there is going to be somebody else to step forward. And when I see no one stepping forward \u2026 it becomes impossible for me not to step in.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan asks Cathy how she came to be a leader, and Cathy responds by telling the story of her formative years, and how in multiple instances, even at the tender age of five, she learned to create order both at home and in the classroom.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;There\u2019s something to leading where you have to be a little bit fearless. Someone has to be at the helm saying \u201cWe\u2019re going to go this way, and I think we\u2019re going to find land.\u201d If you don\u2019t have that person then there\u2019s going to be chaos.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;How do you bear the cost? You\u2019ve known there will be a cost to [leadership] that is on most occasions greater than the so-called benefit. So how have you stayed the course?</p><p><br></p><p>In response, Cathy acknowledges the loneliness, isolation, and&nbsp;<a href="http://theallendercenter.org/2019/07/scapegoating-part-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(147, 74, 38);">scapegoating</a>&nbsp;that occurs when someone becomes a leader. Being a leader does not mean your tasks will get easier, rather the opposite, so learning to develop resilience has been important in Cathy\u2019s leadership journey. She also recognizes the importance of surrounding yourself with mentors and people who can be a steadying presence in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>To close, Dan says the process of leading is worth nothing if it does not call him to be a better person, to be more connected with his friends and colleagues, and to connect him to his relationship with Jesus.</p>',

In this episode, questions about the particularities of being a woman in leadership are posed and thoughtfully addressed.</p><p>To open the conversation, Dan restates the qualities of a good (and oftentimes reluctant) leader and the harmful effects of ambitious leaders. He then asks Cathy to walk through the role of a \u201cgood queen\u201d in an organization within the prophet, priest, king or queen matrix.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;The queen category of those three is about creating order. Being able to hold the role of the priest, who tells the story and the role of the people, create ritual, the prophet calls us to what is meant to be. The queen holds both of those realms in order and goodness for the present. It\u2019s about creating boundaries, saying the true yes and true no, making the hard decisions that will be unpopular but are right for the kingdom, and creating flourishing for all who are involved.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan and Cathy then discuss what it is like to be a \u201cqueen,\u201d or leader in a prophetic organization that is full of priests.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;I think the hardest thing is feeling like you are disappointing people all the time. I want people to see how we can be better, but always feel like your decisions are never quite good enough and it\u2019s always a little too slow or too fast\u2014leadership is complicated.</p><p><br></p><blockquote>\u201cAre you also willing to bear the disappointment of people who are quite brilliant, have a lot of insight, and then be able to bear their face when you say we went a different direction?\u201d</blockquote><p><br></p><p>The conversation then moves into the challenges Cathy faces as a woman in&nbsp;<a href="http://theallendercenter.org/2016/06/binds-of-leadership-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(147, 74, 38);">leadership</a>. Much has changed since she took a leadership role in The Allender Center, and she\u2019s had to go \u201cabove and beyond\u201d to prove she deserves to be at the helm.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;How do you keep your heart from being defensive when you\u2019re having to do so much more than you know I would have to do if I were in that role?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;Even as I talk about it, it just feels so unfair, and that feels young\u2014that feels like a part of me that\u2019s not where I want to lead from. I think it\u2019s been a lot of having to tend to that place that says my experience is true, and it will not win. There\u2019s something more that God is calling me to and if I can actually trust that God has given me some sense of leadership calling and gifting that I\u2019m meant to steward, then that makes it easier because it feels like I\u2019m fighting against spirits and principalities versus people.</p><p><br></p><p>To close the conversation, Dan acknowledges Cathy\u2019s resilience that is due, in part, to having kept her grief about being in a leadership position and what it brings. He asks her, despite the cost, what things she looks forward to in her role.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;Your ability to hold both great strength, ferocity, but equal tenderness and kindness, that\u2019s what I look for in a leader. Will you call me to go die, but also grieve that I may end up losing my life.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;There\u2019s such an opportunity to figure out: What does it look like to lead with strength and passion and fervor but also maintain a sense of the feminine spirit of God? What does it mean for me to see part of my leadership calling as a capacity to hold life in me and birth it and to bring forth goodness and wholeness in a different sort of way than a masculine creating of it?</p>',

As our adult self makes decisions and takes action, can we still let ourselves feel the sadness, fear, and loneliness of our inner child? That was the gut-wrenching challenge faced by&nbsp;<a href="http://theseattleschool.edu/directory/loerzel-cathy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(147, 74, 38);">Cathy Loerzel</a>, Executive Director of The Allender Center after a personal tragedy struck in the summer of 2015.</p><p><br></p><p>Two days ago, my one-and-a-half year-old son was playing in our living room, and I heard the loud growl and jaw snap of my beloved dog Gizmo, quickly followed by the piercing screams of my baby. My body went cold as I leapt over the couch to reach my son, only to see his forehead bleeding and three other teeth marks lodged far too near to his sweet, precious blue eyes. I pulled Liam into my arms, and my husband quickly pulled Gizmo outside as I tended to our son.</p><p><br></p><p>Liam sobbed uncontrollably, tears rolled down my face, and my husband started to assess the severity of our son\u2019s wounds. As we realized the wounds were superficial and Liam would be okay, the reality of what had just transpired began to sink into my heart.</p><p><br></p><p>You see, Liam loves our dog. Gizmo is fluffy and loyal and has been a constant source of delight and fascination for his young and sweet heart. He is an old, big, lumbering dog who is in a great deal of pain and has become increasingly sensitive as his body deteriorates. Gizmo is also the dog that I got from the pound when I completed graduate school. He has been my sweet companion, protector, and comforter for the last eight years of my life. I love him with all that I am. He has seen me through break-ups, best friends moving out, my first Christmas on my own, getting married, and having my first baby. If you ever needed to find me, you could just look for the big golden dog at my feet.</p><p><br></p><p>The horror of seeing something I love so much harm my baby caused my heart to break in five different ways, and the reality of what this inevitably means makes we want to sob from the depths of my heart. For those of you who have never loved a pet, this may seem absurd to you. And of course, the safety of my baby will trump all other things, but the agony of the unavoidable loss of my dog is almost unbearable.</p><p><br></p><p>As I thought about the fact that I will have to say goodbye to this love of my life, I realized this grief has a different feel than other grief I\u2019ve experienced. I think our hearts have different memories and different compartments that are connected to our stories of loss. This particular loss is connected to my little girl heart that loved her doggy. It is my little girl heart that is breaking and my little girl heart that is losing her companion and protector.</p><p><br></p><p>My little girl heart is fragile and scared, and this big fluffy dog gave her comfort when her woman heart just could not hold all the fear. When I was scared at night the first time I slept in my townhouse alone, I crawled onto the floor with Gizmo and buried my face in his soft fur and cried. His long body held me and offered me comfort and fur to wipe my tears. He was the one that woke me up every morning during difficult seasons, circling my bed to beckon for a walk. I did not have to take walks alone because he was with me, I did not have to sleep in a tent alone because he was by my side, keeping me warm and warding away danger. He calmed me when I was sad or anxious, and he laid with me when I broke my foot and was alone on the couch all day. He was by my side late at night when I could not sleep during my last trimester of pregnancy. And when Liam was born, Gizmo was with me at 2 a.m. feedings. He could sense our vulnerability and fiercely protected us from those who approached until he could tell if they were friends or foes.</p><p><br></p><p>He has been the protector of my little girl heart and has loved me with a knowing and loyal soul. And now\u2026now, he is old and in pain and has harmed my sweet son. There is no way I can put words to this heartache. My momma heart is solemn and steadfast and will protect my baby, but my little girl heart is broken and weeping on the floor.</p><p><br></p><p>I don\u2019t know how to bear this level of heartache, and I don\u2019t know how to make the final decision to say goodbye. I know I have to\u2014I will choose well with bravery and honor and say goodbye to my dog, but I will also allow my little girl heart to weep in utter despair at the loss of her beloved soul friend. Gizmo\u2014my sweet pup\u2014I will love you forever, and I\u2019m so grateful for how you have loved me and so grateful for how much I got to love you. You are the best dog I will ever have. Please tell Jesus all about our grand adventures and save a spot for me in heaven.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Note: Gizmo died a beautiful and honorable death on June 12, 2015. He died in my arms and in our backyard, covered with sweet tears of love and gratitude.</em></p>',

I mean, I do\u2014it is an amazing gift to our family to be able to move from our cramped townhouse into a beautiful house with a huge yard for our very active son to play in. We are thrilled and I want to cry. There are many reasons for this. First, moving is just hard\u2014regardless of your circumstances. It is laborious, tedious, expensive, and fraught with details that would drive anyone mad. Second, it means change\u2014deep change. And for those of us who like comfort and routine, this change can be undoing to the core.</p><p><br></p><p>For me it goes even further, I grew up a military kid and I moved every two to three years for the majority of my life. No place really felt like home and moving was just part of life. I was always imagining where we would go next, never attaching or settling into where we were living in the moment. This pattern continued through most of my adult life until 2007 when I bought my first home in Seattle. For the first time I painted, bought furniture and appliances, and made my permanent address a house of my own. I settled into my life, my neighborhood, my walking paths, my coffee shops, and allowed my feet to sink into the soil. I felt like I was home and it was lovely, safe, and comforting. My home has represented a shift from a nomadic wandering to a heart rooted in community and routine. I became attached\u2014and it is no surprise that during this time I sunk into career and calling, rescued a dog, got married, and had a baby.</p><p><br></p><p>Being rooted allowed me to find the places of my heart that had been inaccessible while always looking to the next adventure to dull the disconnected fragments of my life.&nbsp;In that state of disconnectedness, moving was easy because I was detached and never felt the pain of upheaval. As I have allowed my roots to grow deep in this house and neighborhood a sort of healing has taken place. And up till this moment, I have been so grateful. But now I am moving again to a house in which our family can grow and flourish and I am heartbroken having to feel the pain for the first time of being dislodged from my home.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes healing is a double-edged sword. Now I can\u2019t escape the pain of change or the suffering of being uprooted. I can\u2019t choose to just turn it off and buckle up my emotions in order to pack, paint and clean. I am now connected to these sweet roots and must grieve the loss of my beautiful little townhouse tucked behind a fast-food chain where I can hear sirens all day and all night. I must grieve the fact that I have to go to a different grocery store and get to know a new neighborhood. My daily walks will be on a different path and I will have to say goodbye to my local coffee shop baristas. I have spent so much of my life avoiding this suffering and avoiding saying goodbye, but to honor the goodness that this house has brought me, I must suffer the loss.</p><p><br></p><p>As I suffer the loss, new roots will be able to grow and my heart will be open to my new life.&nbsp;It is a strange dichotomy to know I have to grieve and suffer loss in order to find new life. My instinct is to cover my eyes, ignore the heartache and focus on decorating my new space in my mind. But instead, I must welcome my sorrow and sit and stare at my empty walls with boxes stacked to the ceiling and smile with tears at the memories that are stirred.&nbsp;I must stand in my doorway with my little boy in my arms, my husband by my side and my dog circling our feet, take a deep breath, let the tears come and say goodbye to my first home.</p>",

As we talked, I began to ponder the idea of change.&nbsp;<em>Can we really change after a certain point or are we stuck in time, having lost our capacity to bend and mold as we could when we were younger?</em>&nbsp;Most of us sitting around my fireplace that night had young kids sleeping in various places around the house, and we, as their parents, were exhausted, drinking one too many glasses of champagne that would come back to bite us the next morning as our children would inevitably wake at an ungodly hour welcoming in the New Year.</p><p><br></p><p>Our exhaustion was coupled with a gnawing sense that this may be as good as it gets. Can we change? Can we&nbsp;<a href="http://theallendercenter.org/2019/05/defiance-healing-spiritual-abuse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);">become more healed</a>? Can we know more love, more of God, get back into shape, eat healthier, drink less, and become more alive? Or is this the point where we call a spade a spade and release ourselves to a life of maintenance where nothing is ever enough?</p><p><br></p><p>You could see each of us looking at the other, wondering how to reconcile our desire for more with our weary hearts, trying to stay awake until the stroke of midnight and celebrate another year lived. But in truth, our hearts felt deflated as we silently considered our longings for this one, beautiful life while knowing we may not have enough energy left to make a difference.</p><p><br></p><p>It brought into focus my theology of healing. In that moment, none of us had any energy left to make a new resolution, to commit to a new hobby, to try and find more time for our spouse, or to spend more time praying or reading scripture. Life had taken us to the edge of our margin and we all knew it. Even that night, the anticipation of an early wake up call from our bubbly, energetic, needy kids was enough for us to admit defeat before we could even muster the semblance of a fight. So how in that state of hopelessness, how do you grapple with a longing for more despite a heart that feels dead inside, a body that could sleep for weeks, and a bank account that dwindles with each passing crisis? We went to bed grateful for good friends who shared this struggle, but with little to no resolve or answers to our questions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Many of us are pondering what 2020 will bring and who we want to be this year.</strong>&nbsp;Around this time every year, I hear the phrase floating around that is meant to bring motivation and renewed commitment: \u201dNew Year, New You.\u201d That phrase seductively propels us toward the fantasy that things can be better if we just try harder, or become more resolute or more disciplined.</p><p><br></p><p>This time every year I feel desperate to find something that will move me past the depression that often follows the holiday season to help bolster me toward a new season of hope and life.&nbsp;<strong>In reality, \u201cNew Year, New You\u201d is all a lie. We are still \u201cus\u201d as the new year rolls over and celebrate the start of something new.</strong>&nbsp;But the truth is, I am the same on January 1 as I was December 31 and I think the real invitation for the new year is one of allowing ourselves to acknowledge where we are\u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly\u2014 and then grieve the fact that we are tired, overwhelmed, devastatingly alone, and unsure how we are going to make it through this season.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder what healing would come if we let our&nbsp;<a href="http://theallendercenter.org/2019/11/the-loudness-of-grief/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);">heartache set in</a>&nbsp;instead of overriding it. My guess is our hearts would rest and reset knowing there will not be more demand for our performance or resolve, but a soft space to land as we reflect on the year we lived as best as we could.&nbsp;<em>I wonder if our commitment is to grace, kindness, and grief, maybe we would find the life we are hoping for, but without the cruel intentions that come from judgment and self-contempt that so often lace our resolutions for a different life.</em></p><p><br></p><p>We are seduced by \u201cNew Year, New You\u201d and the promise of resolutions because they allow us to ignore our heartache. We can choose to power up, start over, and become better without having to let our bodies dip down into the&nbsp;<a href="https://theallendercenter.org/2014/12/moving-grief/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);">chasm of grief</a>. I have found that when we override this chasm and jump to resolution, we ignore the part of our heart that needs tending to.</p><p><br></p><p>This does not mean that we can\u2019t try and keep our homes cleaner, be more committed to health, get outside more, or take that trip to Paris, but I think we can move toward that life in a countercultural way that lets us truly and intentionally sink into just how difficult this life is to live and be grateful that for the most part, we are doing it really well.</p>',

We are more connected than ever, with thousands of \u201cfriends\u201d online, and yet the collective sense of isolation and disconnection is deep and pervasive. Awareness of widespread loneliness\u2014and its devastating impacts\u2014is growing, say Dan, and \u201cpeople are dying to have their stories heard and engaged.\u201d</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>People are dying to have their stories heard and engaged. </em><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&amp;text=People%20are%20dying%20to%20have%20their%20stories%20heard%20and%20engaged.&amp;url=https://theallendercenter.org/2018/02/story-sage-1/&amp;via=allendercenter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);"><em>Tweet this</em></a></blockquote><p><br></p><p>For years, The Allender Center has been addressing this deep need and desperate longing for connection. Story Sage will mark a significant step in that work as we continue to make our teaching and resources accessible for as many people as possible. The course will be divided into two separate classes: one about tools and frameworks for engaging stories well, and one that illustrates those concepts as Dan interacts with a woman who\u2019s engaging her own story of sexual abuse.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cWhat we tried to do in this series is pull back the curtain a little.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Cathy reflects on her experience training facilitators and seeing over and over again how difficult it is to remain curious about and attuned to others\u2014even for people who care deeply about this work and want to do it well. We bump up against the resistance and defenses that are rooted in our own story, not to mention the endless distractions and competing priorities of day-to-day life. To remain present with and curious about another person as you step into their stories of heartache and harm\u2014that is an art, and it is far more costly than just being a \u201cgood listener.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cSo often our work is to move past empathy and advice.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachael:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cTo move to that deeper level takes both skill and a kind of wisdom\u2014and courage.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Rachael, Cathy, and Dan begin unpacking the themes of attunement, containment, and rupture and repair that are essential for meaningful conversations, and they reflect on the challenge of pursuing deep connection even in our own families and friendships. Next week, they will continue this discussion by sharing more about the Story Sage online course and by exploring more of the nuts and bolts of facilitating healing in the stories of others.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cOur profoundly lonely hearts are aching. Engaging in these sorts of conversations is both what our hearts are made for and what will bring life.\u201d</p>',

That engagement opens the door to discuss what is perhaps the most volatile and precipitous terrain in this work: family of origin.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachael:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cWhen we use words like attunement, containment, repair, we\u2019re talking about attachment. And we know that our family of origin is where our primary attachment structures get developed.

But even beginning to wonder about that, for many people, feels like betrayal\u2014meaning we will encounter suspicion, defenses, and deep fear.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cPart of what it means to be a story sage is to know how to walk through minefields without blowing yourself up or the person that you\u2019re walking with. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>As the conversation unfolds, they share their hope that Story Sage will be an opportunity for you to grow your own unique gifts and calling. This is not about learning to do what Dan does, but about gaining tools and theories to build your own capacity to engage stories with freedom, fluidity, and power\u2014and in a way that only you can.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachael:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things this course offers: a lot more categories, and a framework to even be able to build an imagination around how you could possibly move into someone\u2019s story with a little more wisdom.\u201d</p>',

When we have our Eden blown up, what\u2019s then discovered is that we\u2019ve been on a long path of trying to find our way back.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOur task is inviting people into a framework to consider their own trauma and abuse story as it then opens new meaning and power to understand the story of Jesus\u2019 death, resurrection, and ascension.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Our Training Certificate was formed out of the core assumption that trauma is far more widespread than many people would like to believe. A common perception is that trauma affects only an unfortunate few, but the reality is that all of us bear stories of betrayal and loss that introduce some level of trauma in our lives.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTrauma is the unexpected and profound shattering of our sense of normalcy. It comes with any significant injury or violation, any kind of deep-hearted insult that erodes not only our sense of normalcy, but in some ways erodes our sense of future. Therefore it brings a significant disruption to our sense of self. [\u2026] Those realities are not something that only the professional class of therapist or helper is intended to engage. Really the frontline of engagement with these matters has to do with the believing community being able to walk alongside of others into invite them into a process in which life is reconfigured, realigned, and in many ways, reformed.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Dan talks about how traumatic experiences disregulate our bodies, leaving us in a perpetual state of fight, flight, or freeze, as well as our memory and our ability to engage our own stories without being overwhelmed, disoriented, and retraumatized.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got this mess going on, and what often happens is that my very heart, soul, mind, and being are cast into this disruptive ocean. Now the question is, who will I become?\u201d</p><p>In engaging trauma, the first task is to help find some sense of stability\u2014the fundamental feeling that we will be able to survive. Then, as friends, families, and communities of faith, we are called to walk with individuals through the process of discovering new beauty, new goodness, and a fuller sense of self\u2014out of the very places that have been so marked by pain and brokenness.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTrauma gives us a context to engage the upheaval, not only to help mitigate it and to stabilize, but to actually walk with a person through the process of helping them reform, reconfigure, who they wish to be in the midst of a world that brings and allows this kind of harm.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The Allender Center\u2019s Training Certificate includes four unique weekend sessions over the course of an 8-month journey. In the first week, participants reflect on and share the tragedy\u2014no matter how small or insignificant it seems\u2014in their own story, and they begin to engage the stories of others in the context of a small group led by one of our trained facilitators. The second week focuses on attachment, containment, and the failure of attunement in our families of origin. The third week invites participants to wrestle with their sexual history, identifying the people, events, processes, and beliefs that have formed them into the person they are today. In the fourth and final week, participants look at their own unique gifts, talents, and callings the unique directions they can take this work in their families, communities, churches, and careers.</p><p><br></p><p>As we continue this series in future weeks, Dan will invite his wife, Becky Allender, to reflect on her experience in the Training Certificate, and then we will hear from Cathy Loerzel, co-founder of The Allender Center, about her heart behind creating opportunities for leaders and professionals to do in-depth work in their own stories and help foster healing in the stories of others.</p>',

She shares how working as a research assistant on Dan\u2019s&nbsp;<a href="http://theallendercenter.org/store/products/sabbath/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);"><em>Sabbath</em></a>&nbsp;book eventually led to the opportunity to teach and facilitate groups, particularly at the intersection of trauma and spiritual formation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachael:&nbsp;</strong>\u201cI just fell in love with getting to do story work in a group setting with people. It was the best kind of pastoral care you could ever do. [\u2026] I really, really love journeying with people in the midst of their stories where their theological imagination, biblical imagination, the way they understand themselves in relation to God, God in relation to them, has been disordered because of the harm they\u2019ve experienced.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:&nbsp;</strong>\u201cIt\u2019s crucial and so simple to say you can deal with the depths of a person\u2019s horizontal story, their relationships with others, but always, always, always our labor is ultimately about your heart with Jesus, your engagement with God. </p><p><br></p><p>And unfortunately or fortunately, the framework of your trauma provides a very substantial lens for how you interpret life in relationship to how you see God.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Cathy talks about the ongoing work of creating a standardized training program that allows for the particularities of every individual and the artistry of story work, while also offering the theoretical education and technical training that allows space for nuance and creativity. The desire to offer all of that, and to distill Dan\u2019s complex theories into a practical, hands-on training, gave birth to The Allender Center\u2019s Training Certificate and the Externship Program.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:&nbsp;</strong>\u201cWe\u2019re able to do a catalytic event that allows people who are very specifically trained to read into difficult stories and reveal things that are not typically revealed in an average reading of story. [\u2026] How many people can we train over the next 10 years? How many people can we equip who are doing this work on the ground as lay leaders, as pastors, as friends, as spouses? My dream is to continue to equip people to go into the trenches and bring some sort of healing and allow Jesus to be revealed in ways that don\u2019t happen through average care.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachael:&nbsp;</strong>\u201cPart of what we do is give people categories through which to interpret their story more truthfully, to give them more freedom. So when I\u2019m working with people I want to create a sanctuary where there is safety, and goodness, and a place for healing, but also a call to arms, that they would be empowered to come to life, to take what they\u2019re receiving and learning and be able to offer that others.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:&nbsp;</strong>\u201cThe design and desire is to give it away, to train people to be able to go out, somewhat under our experienced supervision and input, but go out and start works that engage, in your local church and your community, life and resurrection in the face of trauma. [\u2026] We\u2019re not going to be embarrassed to say, in some sense, this is an invitation to come check us out and begin to ask, how are you called to engage the issues of trauma, and how can we join you in the work of God to help you become better at what you do?\u201d</p>',

Cathy shares how she stumbled on the movie on HBO this summer and immediately started alerting our team about it; Dan recalls that it was less of a recommendation than a command: \u201cYou need to watch this film.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cIt was one of the most excruciating, troubling, confirming films that I have ever seen in terms of the work that we do here at The Allender Center.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cI had to take three Tums just to get through the sense of nausea and heartbreak. It is a stunning film. For anyone who has addressed, is addressing, is working with the issues of trauma and abuse, this is a must-see film.\u201d</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>So few people are talking about the reality of childhood sexual abuse. </em><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&amp;text=So%20few%20people%20are%20talking%20about%20the%20reality%20of%20childhood%20sexual%20abuse.&amp;url=https://theallendercenter.org/2018/10/trauma-memory-the-tale-1/&amp;via=allendercenter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);"><em>Tweet this</em></a></blockquote><p><br></p><p>While&nbsp;<em>The Tale</em>&nbsp;is intense, devastating, and potentially triggering for abuse survivors, Cathy and Dan stress that it is not gratuitous. With great insight and creativity, it tells the story of what happens in childhood sexual abuse and wrestles with how that story continues to unfold in adulthood. Dan and Cathy discuss how many of the dynamics that emerge in the film\u2014like the grooming, ambivalence, and family of origin realities that mark stories of abuse\u2014bring to life much of the theory that we engage at The Allender Center.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cA lot of the work that we do is taking bits of memory and creating the movie around it, bringing a black and white description into color and putting a fabric around it, putting texture around it, putting smells and even the scenery around it in a different way that allows people to step into abuse memories in a different sort of way. That\u2019s what Jennifer Fox is doing in this movie.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The narrative structure of&nbsp;<em>The Tale</em>, crafted with such clear thoughtfulness and care, is a reflection of the fragmentation that marks stories of trauma. It wrestles with deep questions about memory, truth, intention, and so much more\u2014without offering quick or easy answers. Instead, it pulls you into the fragmentation of memory and the horror of the truth.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cIn the process, you\u2019re going to discover that her memory is present, but it\u2019s past. It\u2019s fragmented, it\u2019s distorted, it\u2019s accurate, inaccurate. And the past speaks to the future. The 13-year-old girl interacts with the adult woman, just as we already know that memory is never a kind of verbatim story or narrative. It\u2019s fragmented. [\u2026] It\u2019s brilliant how she tells the story, and yet you have to enter her fragmentation to be able to follow the story, which can\u2019t be followed.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Cathy and Dan discuss other aspects of the film that reflect its brilliance: the seductive allure of the abusers, the awareness that abuse never occurs in a vacuum, the cunning nature of evil, and the way abuse fosters a war with our desire for connection. All of this is so crucial to engaging our stories with the hope of healing, and we are deeply grateful for\u2014and awed by\u2014Jennifer Fox for sharing this story. Join us next week as Dan and Cathy continue this conversation. And if you\u2019re able to do so in a way that feels honoring to your own story, we do recommend watching&nbsp;<em>The Tale</em>&nbsp;(available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hbo.com/movies/the-tale" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);">HBO</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tale-Laura-Dern/dp/B07D8LTCL1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);">Amazon</a>) before our next episode.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cYou will find it a resource for honor and grief. It will help you honor and engage the story of others with far more sensitivity. And if it\u2019s part of your own story, even though there are things that will be radically different, I believe that it will give you new grief. I felt new grief, and yet new honor about the great privilege that we have to be part of a community that addresses trauma and abuse.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><em style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(31, 53, 59);">Image courtesy of&nbsp;</em><a href="https://thetalemovie.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(216, 119, 95);"><em>thetalemovie.com</em></a><em style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(31, 53, 59);">.</em></p>',

Cathy and Dan discuss more of the dynamics that make this such an important work of art, and they reflect on categories for further discussion and exploration\u2014like the surprising and disturbing presence of arousal even in the midst of abuse.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cIt sounds weird to say, but this film is arousing. And no one wants to be aroused by a story about sexual abuse, which is why no one wants to talk about it. [\u2026] But the degree that you\u2019re familiar with your own arousal is the degree to which you\u2019ll be able to stay with someone else\u2019s abuse stories and trauma stories.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>There is an alluring nature to the tenderness and affection directed toward Jennifer by her abusers in their work of grooming. Cathy and Dan discuss how, if we cannot acknowledge our body\u2019s response to that allure\u2014if we cannot name our desire for connection and intimacy\u2014then surviving our stories of abuse will necessitate silencing our bodies and cursing our desire.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cThe depth of the complicity is only understood with regard to this refraction of horror that any abused person has to grapple with, and that is: my body betrayed me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever had any kind of work of art confirm and come alongside as such a friend of our own labor. </em><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&amp;text=I%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%20if%20I%E2%80%99ve%20ever%20had%20any%20kind%20of%20work%20of%20art%20confirm%20and%20come%20alongside%20as%20such%20a%20friend%20of%20our%20own...&amp;url=https://theallendercenter.org/2018/11/trauma-memory-the-tale-2/&amp;via=allendercenter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(216, 119, 95);"><em>Tweet this</em></a></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Much of Dan\u2019s theory and our framework at The Allender Center explores the connection between arousal and disgust\u2014an unsettling sense of arousal is often on the flip side of abuse. As we walk with others through their stories of harm, we find that much of our work resides in those places where we are more comfortable with our disgust than with our arousal\u2014that\u2019s where the war of shame lies.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cIt\u2019s very shame inducing to start stepping into this, but I think you have to in order to bring any sort of honor and healing into these parts of our hearts.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cAnd no victim is ever meant to be the sole guardian of their own story, which is why the shame that comes with complicity, arousal, fear, judgement, contempt\u2014it silences and isolates. No one is meant to be alone in this memory.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>We are deeply grateful to HBO for helping bring this film to the world, and we\u2019re especially grateful to Jennifer Fox for her courage, insight, and artistry. May Jennifer\u2019s bravery in telling her story light a path for many, many others to engage their own stories and wrestle with the realities of abuse in creative and innovative ways.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t be able to create this film if she hadn\u2019t done that work, if she hadn\u2019t gone back and allowed her own heart and mind to tell the truth in a different sort of way. I commend her for the work she\u2019s done and for how brave she is in bringing it to the public. Our hope in talking about this is that this would be another vehicle for us to continue to speak truth, and to find freedom. It\u2019s not just about telling the truth. It\u2019s because the truth will set you free.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cWe need art. We need beauty. And this is a beautiful film. [\u2026] We need art to tell the truth. Because the truth itself, in its own fragmentation, needs images, scenes, scenarios. It needs music, it needs poetry, it needs painting, it needs film. That\u2019s part of the engagement with the truth.\u201d</p>',

She desires for women to know that their bodies are good, that their arousal cycles and body were created with intention.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Christy:</strong>&nbsp;What does it mean to be curious about what is happening in our bodies and what we\u2019re feeling and experiencing and what is it inviting us to?</p><p>Cathy responds by discussing the myth that women\u2019s bodies aren\u2019t meant for pleasure, or for our own pleasure, and relates a personal experience as an example.</p><p>In terms of what she wishes happened more often and that she had herself, Rachael brings up the need for more open and honest conversations for adolescents around the topic of women\u2019s sexuality. Oftentimes this period of time is surrounded by much shame and isolation as young women learn what it means to be a sexual being.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cathy:</strong>&nbsp;How do we tend to those parts of ourselves so there can be a continuous awakening so that we can be in our bodies in a way that we don\u2019t feel shame or contempt?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachael:</strong>&nbsp;There is something about our sexuality that is meant to bear the image of God, that is meant to be a prayer, and is deeply connected to our capacity for hope. I think as women we do need to cultivate more spaces where we can come together and talk honestly about our struggles.</p><p><br></p><p>Rachael, Cathy, and Christy also have an important discussion around the reality of a woman\u2019s body, including the scars often kept hidden\u2014even from themselves. They talk about needing to step into these places with hope, reverence, and love to acknowledge the reality of living in a broken, beautiful, wounded, and good body.</p><p><br></p><p>To close, each share their final hopes for women as they begin to step into these spaces of fighting for goodness, for connecting the spirit of God to their sexuality, and for taking the risk to want and desire a different kind of intimacy, blessing, and prayer.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theology-Womb-Knowing-through-Woman/dp/1532662173" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(147, 74, 38);"><em>Theology of the Womb</em></a>, by Christy Bauman</p><p><a href="https://theallendercenter.org/2020/01/womens-sexuality-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(147, 74, 38);">What Women Wish Men Knew about Women\u2019s Sexuality</a></p><p><a href="https://theallendercenter.org/2019/11/men-women-sexuality/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(147, 74, 38);">What Men Wish Women Knew about Men\u2019s Sexuality</a></p><p><a href="https://theallendercenter.org/2019/10/men-sexuality/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(147, 74, 38);">What Men Wish Men Knew about Men\u2019s Sexuality</a></p>',

Together we explore: What if I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had trauma? Do I still need to do heart work? Why do I need to look back at my past? My present is hard enough. Why do I act this way in challenging situations? Join us?",

      "<p>These past 18 months have been hard. Hard on a personal level, hard on a professional level, and hard on a collective level. The pandemic has disconnected so many of us from the embodied wisdom of community, friendships, and relationships. We have needed to be physically removed for safety, but also we have been separated based on ideologies and deep skisms that have life and death seemingly attached to them. We are divided and skeptical and don\u2019t know where to turn. The toll has been brutal and severe. Even more than we know at this point. We need care, wisdom, and direction as we navigate a complex, heartbreaking, and ever-changing world. We need wise elders and people who have come before us who can steady the ship and set a new course.</p><p><br></p><p>For me, I found myself longing for a grandmother. A wise guide who would invite me into her home, make me tea, and teach me the art of making bread or a delicious berry pie. I longed for her to listen to my plight, my confusion, and my heartache and tell me how it was all going to be ok. I wanted her to remind me of who I am and who I could become. I longed for her to see my face, realize I was exhausted, take me to her spare bedroom, and invite me to rest while the bread baked. And while my fantasy was rich and lovely, I knew in my heart that no one was coming. There was no magical grandmother that could help me navigate this season of my life and I was alone. I was alone to read the books, glean the wisdom I needed, and try to decipher the code coming through my many screens and texts.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was not working. I was desperate, and words on my own were not enough. Then this past winter, as much of my world was falling apart, I began the bold move of gathering with some women from my church. I had been isolated, in a deep season of turmoil and trauma, and needed a community of women who were committed to seeing the fullness of the world and would also place pillows under my body as I hit the bottom. We were each heartbroken in some way and left to navigate the season without a wise mother to guide us through. We were often wandering rudderless to make our own way. But as we met and talked, we realized that between all of our experiences of sorrow, grief, and heartache, there was one wise woman.&nbsp;<em>We&nbsp;</em>were the wise guide we needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Collectively, we could hold each other and allow our pieces of wisdom to collide and become whole on behalf of each of us individually. There was enough to go around, and as our friendships progressed, we were able to hold dreams, hopes, calling, grief, fear, and combat curses against our body and souls.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><strong><em>Together, we found the wise woman, and because it was not up to one of us individually, we were able to carry each other\u2019s burden with ease and compassion.</em></strong></blockquote><p><br></p><p>We were willing to help hold the complexity of who we were without either idealizing our circumstances or dismissing our pain. We were truth tellers and soul tenders, and in the end, I found myself literally being held up by their arms, floating in a pool, and grieving years of painful failure and loss.</p><p><br></p><p>Together, they were strong enough to hold me, tender enough to wipe my tears, and loving enough to tell me I was good and also enough. It was the embodied wisdom and care I so deeply longed for, and it was utterly life changing. We were the wise woman, and instead of waiting for the non-existent rescuer to appear, we rose up and became what we all needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of us are left desiring a singular person we can fully trust and drop into their wise arms and weep, but what if that which we desire is already here? What if it is not one person but all of us, together, that we really need? If that\u2019s true, then we can be human sized, imperfect, broken, needy, and wise all at the same time. We don\u2019t need to be heroic or all knowing, but we do need to be brave enough to risk presence and be available with whatever we can offer. If we can trust that those parts are enough, we can find a deep well of wisdom residing in the power of the women in our midst. We are the mothers we need; we are the wisdom that is born of suffering and loss. Together, we are enough.</p>",
